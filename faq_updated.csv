Myth busted! – “But this property has never flooded before.”,"Floods bigger than those we have experienced are inevitable. We have less than 200 years of formal flood records in Australia. While there may be no living memory or formal record of your property flooding, it does not mean that the land has not flooded in past centuries nor that it won't flood in coming years."
Myth busted! – “But I live on a hill so floods won’t affect me.”,"Hills are not always free of floods. This can happen in two ways. 1. Creeks and rivers can rise several meters when they flood which means that land we think would be high and dry can end up being well under water. 2. When water is running down the hill to the creek or river it will find the easiest path to follow. Sometimes during a severe storm the pipes or kerb and guttering cannot handle all the water and the water will find its own path which could even be through properties on hills. Even if your property is not flooded, you may be isolated by floodwaters and you may not be able to leave or enter your property safely until floodwaters have subsided."
Myth busted! – “But I don’t even live near a creek or a river so floods won’t affect me.”,"Water finds its way in unexpected places. This can happen in two ways. 1. When creeks and rivers burst their banks, the water can spread several hundred meters (even kilometers). 2. When water is running down the hill to the creek or river, it will find the easiest path to follow. Sometimes during a severe storm the pipes or kerb and guttering cannot handle all the water and the water will find its own path which could even be through properties on hills."
Myth busted! – “My home is above the flood level so floods won’t affect me.”,"Floods can go higher than we plan for. In Australia, the flood planning level is usually defined by the 100-year flood. Floods can go higher than the 100-year flood level. This is not a flood which happens once every 100 years but one which has a 1 in 100 or 1% chance of occurring in each and every year. In a 70-year lifetime, there is a 50/50 chance of a 1 in 100 flood being exceeded at any location. Two such floods can occur one after the other. In 2007, rainfall exceeded the 1 in 100 event on the Sunshine Coast in Queensland, and again in 2011."
Myth busted! – “But I won’t even be here in 100 years ...so a 1 in 100 year flood won’t affect me.”,"Extreme floods can happen at any time. In Australia, new buildings are usually built above the 100-year flood level. This is not a flood which happens once every 100 years but one which has a 1 in 100 or 1% chance of occurring in each and every year. In a 70-year lifetime, there is a 50/50 chance of a 1 in 100 flood being exceeded at any location. In fact, given the wet and dry phases that occur in many regions of Australia, these events are likely to be clustered in time."
Myth busted! – “We’re protected by levees where I live so flood won’t affect me.”,"Levees can provide limited protection to buildings and infrastructure. It is not practical to build levees high enough to keep out all floods. Every levee has a chance of being overtopped by floodwaters and as such, communities should be prepared to evacuate to reduce the exposure to flood risks. When a levee overtops or fails, the water may rise very quickly in the areas which the levee was protecting. Many have been built by individuals privately and may not be properly maintained. Failures of levees occur regularly and can result in worse flooding in areas directly behind the failed levee than would occur naturally."
Myth busted! – “But I thought that dams were supposed to stop all flooding.”,"Flood mitigation dams can reduce downstream flood levels by temporarily storing and later releasing floodwaters. Most dams are used to supply water to the community, but they can, when purpose-built, also provide some flood mitigation for events up to their flood storage capacity. However, in larger floods, this mitigation capacity can be exceeded, and floods pass through with little, if any, reduction. The effectiveness of dams depends on where in the catchment the rain falls. If it falls downstream of the dam, then the dam cannot mitigate flooding from that rainfall event. Dams can cause disruption to existing communities, loss of valuable land, and negative environmental impacts, and good sites for dams are difficult to locate. Detention basins act like dams but at a much smaller scale and are most suitable for 'green field' developments, where sizing constraints tend not to exist."
Myth busted! – “But I thought it would never flood during a drought.”,"Flooding can happen at any time. Queensland has one of the most variable rainfalls in the world and experiences both regular and severe floods, and long droughts. In fact, significant flooding, and even record rainfall and flooding can occur in the middle of a drought without the drought breaking. For example, the 25 January-14 February 2019 flooding from the North and Far North Queensland Monsoon Trough saw over half of Queensland’s councils, covering more than 56% of Queensland’s land mass, activated for disaster funding assistance. Prior to the Monsoon Trough, more than half of Queensland was suffering prolonged drought, and following the Monsoon Trough, 67.4% of Queensland was drought declared."
Myth busted! – “But I thought that these sandbags would stop my home from flooding.”,"Sandbags placed in appropriate locations around your home or business can reduce the impact of flooding. Sandbags will not stop the water completely, but can reduce the amount of water entering. Raising valuables off the floor may prevent damage to personal items from floodwater that may still enter."
Myth busted! – “I can drive through floodwaters – it won’t affect my car.”,"It is dangerous and illegal to drive through floodwaters. Even shallow water can sweep a car off the road. In many cases, insurance does not cover water damage from driving through floodwaters."
Myth busted! – “But I can swim to safety in floodwaters.”,"Attempting to swim in floodwaters is extremely dangerous. Swift currents, debris, and hidden hazards make it a life-threatening decision."
Myth busted! – “The flood won’t affect me because I can live off the land.”,"Reliable access to food and clean water during floods can be limited. Flooding can disrupt transportation, contaminate water supplies, and make crops and livestock inaccessible. Relying on living off the land during a flood is not a safe or practical plan."
Myth busted! – “I don’t need flood insurance because the government will cover my losses.”,"Flood insurance is not typically covered by standard homeowners' or renters' insurance. Government assistance may be available, but it is often in the form of low-interest loans that need to be repaid. Having flood insurance can provide more comprehensive coverage and financial protection."
Myth busted! – “I’ll evacuate when I see the water rising.”,Waiting until the water is rising to evacuate is dangerous. Floodwaters can rise rapidly and can trap you in your home. It's important to have an evacuation plan and follow local authorities' guidance on when to evacuate.
"Myth busted! – “But I have a basement, so I'm safe from flooding.”","Basements are at risk of flooding, especially during heavy rainfall and flash floods. They can fill with water quickly, posing a danger to occupants and causing extensive damage to property."
"Myth busted! – “My home is built to withstand floods, so I don't need to prepare.”","While some homes are designed to withstand floods, no building is entirely flood-proof. It's still important to prepare, have an evacuation plan, and protect your belongings in case of flooding."
"Myth busted! – “My possessions are replaceable, so I'm not worried about flooding.”","While possessions can be replaced, flooding can lead to emotional distress, financial burdens, and loss of irreplaceable items like family heirlooms. It's essential to take steps to protect your belongings from flood damage."
Myth busted! – “I don’t need to prepare for floods; they won’t happen to me.”,"Floods can happen to anyone, and it's essential to be prepared. Even areas that have not experienced flooding in many years can still be at risk, and preparation can make a significant difference in protecting your home and family."
"Myth busted! – “But I don’t know how to swim, so I can’t be prepared for floods.”","Swimming is not a requirement for flood preparedness. Staying informed, having an emergency kit, evacuation plan, and knowing safe routes to higher ground are more important than swimming skills during a flood."
Myth busted! – “I don’t need an emergency kit; I can buy supplies during a flood.”,"During a flood, stores may be inaccessible or out of supplies. Having an emergency kit with essential items like food, water, first aid, and medications is crucial to your safety and well-being."
Myth busted! – “I can use my phone's flashlight during a power outage.”,Relying solely on a phone's flashlight during a power outage can drain the battery quickly. It's a good idea to have additional battery-powered or hand-crank flashlights in your emergency kit.
Myth busted! – “But I don't have time to prepare for a flood; I'll do it later.”,"Procrastinating flood preparedness can put you and your family at risk. It's important to prepare in advance, as floods can occur suddenly and without warning. Don't delay preparing your emergency kit and evacuation plan."
Myth busted! – “My pets will be fine on their own during a flood.”,"Pets are vulnerable during floods. It's essential to include them in your emergency plans, with supplies and a safe place for them to stay. Leaving pets behind can put their lives at risk."
Myth busted! – “But I don't want to evacuate and leave my home during a flood.”,"While it's natural to want to protect your home, staying during a flood can be extremely dangerous. Following evacuation orders from local authorities is crucial to ensure your safety."
Myth busted! – “I'll be able to call for help if needed during a flood.”,"During a flood, communication infrastructure can be disrupted, and cell phone service may be unavailable. Having alternative communication methods like a battery-powered radio or satellite phone is important."
Myth busted! – “I can handle floodwaters on my own without assistance.”,"Attempting to handle floodwaters alone can be risky. It's important to follow the guidance of local authorities, first responders, and emergency services for your safety during a flood."
